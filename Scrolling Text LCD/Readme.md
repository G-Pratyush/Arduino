Display your name on a 16*2 LCD Display in a left scrolling fashion, using an Arduino UNO.
I made the circuit using an Arduino UNO R3, a LCD Display(16x2), a potentiometer, a breadboard.
Potentiometer is used to control the Contrast of the LCD.
Code:   I have set the cursor to (0,0) position each time the loop iterates
	Then I have printed some part of my name followed by the remaining part
	which gets cut due to the left scroll.
